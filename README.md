SOLID Principles tutorial _ Object-Oriented Programming




Single responsibility principle: 
A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.


Open–closed principle: 
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."


Liskov substitution principle: 
"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.


Interface segregation principle: 
"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."


Dependency inversion principle
One should "depend upon abstractions, not concretions".
